# Course Building Guide

Welcome to the official OpenGolfSim course building docs! Here you'll find guides and documentation about building your own courses for OpenGolfSim!

At the time of writing. Building courses for OGS is still a very manual (and experimental) process and requires some existing knowledge of 3D and design tools like Unity and Inkscape. We've built some custom tools ([Course Terrain Tool](/tools/utilities/course-terrain-tool) and [Course Meshery](/tools/utilities/course-meshery)) and have some helpful scripts and menus for Unity to make process a bit less painful.

Some helpful tips:

- **Work in small chunks.** It will be tempting to build out your full course right away, but the larger more complex the course, the more prone to issues. If you build a hole or two at a time and get them playable, it'll be easier to figure out issues as you go.

- **Be detail oriented.** Missing or skipping steps may not matter at first. But could compound into larger issues later.

- **Provide feedback.** Reach out on [Discord](/connect-with-us) to report bugs, discuss features, brainstorm or just say hi!


If you haven't already, make sure you complete the steps in the [Getting Started](/tools/getting-started) section before diving into our course building guide.
