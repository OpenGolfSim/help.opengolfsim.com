# Square Golf

You can connect your Square Golf launch monitor over bluetooth using our built-in connector.

1. Go to the **Settings** > **Shot Data** section of OpenGolfSim.
2. Select **Change Launch Monitor**
3. Select **Square Golf** from the list.
4. A bluetooth scan for the device will start. Make sure the device is on and in pairing mode (blinking bluetooth light).
5. When a device is discovered it should give you the option to select it.
6. The device should now be paired and ready for use.

### Troubleshooting

If OpenGolfSim can't locate the device, make sure the device is in range. Reach out in our [Discord](/connect-with-us/) and we can try and help troubleshoot any issues.
