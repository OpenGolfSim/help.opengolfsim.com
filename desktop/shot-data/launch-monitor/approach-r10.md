# Garmin Approach R10

We have an experimental Approach R10 integration with our OGS Core simulator software. Below you'll find instructions and troubleshooting tips for connecting your Approach R10.

{: .note }
> The experimental Garmin Approach R10 connector is currently available on Windows platforms only.

## Windows Setup

First, you'll need to add the Approach R10 to your paired bluetooth devices in Windows.

1. Open **Settings** > **Bluetooth**
2. Select **Add Bluetooth device**
3. Turn **Approach R10** on in pairing mode (hold down the power button)
4. Select device when discovered. The device should briefly connect and then disconnect. This is normal, just make sure the device remains in your paired devices list.

## OpenGolfSim

To setup the Approach R10 as your primary OpenGolfSim launch monitor:

1. Open **OpenGolfSim Desktop** and select **Simulator** in the sidebar.

2. When prompted to configure your launch monitor, selected the **Approach R10** option.<br>(Note: If you have already setup a launch monitor, you can go to **Settings > Shot Data** to change your launch monitor)

## Operation

Once the initial setup is complete, the launch monitor should automatically pair with OpenGolfSim when turned on.
