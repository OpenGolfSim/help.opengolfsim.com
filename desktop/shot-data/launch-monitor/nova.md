# Open Launch Nova

You can connect an <a href="https://openlaunch.io" target="_blank">OpenLaunch Nova</a> launch monitor over your local network using our built-in connector.

1. Go to the **Settings** > **Shot Data** section of OpenGolfSim.
2. Select **Change Launch Monitor**
3. Select **OpenLaunch Nova** from the list.
4. Make sure the device is powered on and OpenGolfSim should automatically discover and connect to the device.

### Troubleshooting

If OpenGolfSim can't locate the device, it usually indicates a network discovery issue. Reach out in our [Discord](/connect-with-us/) and we can try and help troubleshoot any network issues.
