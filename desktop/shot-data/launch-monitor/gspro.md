## Using OpenGolfSim LM tools with GSPro

You can optionally use OpenGolfSim's launch monitor connectors with GSPro. This allows you to seamlessly switch between OpenGolfSim courses and GSPro, all while keeping your shot data, video replay, and control features all in one place.

1. Use GSPro's <a href="https://gsprogolf.com/convert.html" target="_blank">License Conversion Tool</a> to switch your license to `OpenAPI`.
2. Select the `Use with GSPro` option in OpenGolfSim when setting up your launch monitor, or under **Settings** > **Simulator**.
