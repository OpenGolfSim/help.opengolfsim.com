# Shot Data

OpenGolfSim Desktop integrates directly with some launch monitors and third-party software to allow you to view and store your shot data. It can store a detailed shot history for later review, which can be especially useful for tracking progress, identifying patterns, or analyzing performance across sessions.

## What Gets Tracked

The app stores any shot data that your launch monitor or simulator software provides between the tee and the last shot before the cup. This includes things like:

- Ball Speed
- Club Speed
- Angle of Attack  
- Carry
- Horizontal Launch Angle (HLA)
- Vertical Launch Angle (VLA)
- Back Spin
- Side Spin

## Viewing Shot History

You can view past shots in the **Shot Log** section of the desktop app:

After installing OpenGolfSim be sure to **enable** the Collect Shot Data option from the Shot Data settings. 


{: .note }
> Also keep in mind most launch monitors measure basic data such as club and ball speed, but rely on calculations for key metrics like carry distance and shot shape.

## Coming Soon
