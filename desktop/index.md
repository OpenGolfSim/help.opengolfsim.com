OpenGolfSim is a full golf simulator platform that brings together simulation, control, video, and analytics into one unified experience. At the heart of it is OpenGolfSim Desktop, a Windows-based application that includes a free simulator and connects your hardware (like a control box), mobile devices, and optional features such as video replay, shot tracking, and analytics to level up your golf sim experience.

It can be your primary simulator or run quietly in the background of other simulator apps, ready to respond to your inputs and streamline gameplay. Whether you're using a tablet to trigger mulligans or reviewing your last shot in slow motion, OpenGolfSim keeps everything talking to each other. This documentation walks you through installation, setup, and troubleshooting to get everything working smoothly.
