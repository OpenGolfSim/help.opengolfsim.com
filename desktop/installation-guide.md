## First Launch & Setup

After installation, OpenGolfSim will launch automatically and appear as a new icon in your Windows taskbar. Here’s what happens next:

- **Firewall prompt (optional)**  
  On some systems, Windows may ask to allow access. Approve it so the app can communicate with other devices over the network.

- **Runs in the background**  
  OpenGolfSim functions as a system service, staying out of the way while staying connected. To close OpenGolfSim Desktop select File then "Exit OpenGolfSim" or quit the app from the systems tray.

- **Account login required**  
  The first time you open the app, you’ll be prompted to log in with your OpenGolfSim account. This ties your settings and features to your profile.

- **Auto-updates**  
  The app will automatically check for updates and apply them in the background, so you’re always running the latest version.

- Start a round and play!
