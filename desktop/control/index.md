# Control

OpenGolfSim gives you multiple ways to control your golf sim gameplay:

- Virtual control box using our [iOS or Android app](/mobile/).
- Physical control box or with USB joystick or gamepad devices.
- Your own scripts or automations using our Developer API

Take a mulligan, adjusting aim, or triggering a drop, these methods give you access to gameplay actions without walking over to your computer and fumbling for the keyboard or mouse.
